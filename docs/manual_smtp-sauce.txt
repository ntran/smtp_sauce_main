------ DESCRIPTION ------
SMTP-SAUCE is a program based on SMTP-SOURCE. 
In additional, it provides sending emails with 
random attachments, random length and a timer. 


----- Supported SMTP-SOURCE arguments -----

-4	Connect to the server with IPv4. This option has no
        effect  when Postfix is built without IPv6 support.

-6	Connect to the server with IPv6. This option is not
        available  when  Postfix is built without IPv6 support.

-A     	Don't abort when the server sends  something  other
        than the expected positive reply code.

-c	Display  a running counter that is incremented each
        time an SMTP DATA command completes.

-C   count
        When a host sends RESET  instead  of  SYN|ACK,  try
        count  times before giving up. The default count 1. 
	Specify a larger count in order to work around a
       	problem with TCP/IP stacks that send RESET when the
        listen queue is full.

-d	Don't disconnect after sending a message; send  the
        next message over the same connection.

-f   from		
	Use   the   specified   sender   address  
	(default: <foo@myhostname>).

-F   file
	Send the pre-formatted message header and body in the
	specified file, while prepending '.' before lines that 
	begin with '.', and while appending CRLF after each line.

-l   length
        Send  length  bytes  as message payload. The length
        does not include message headers.

-L     	Speak LMTP rather than SMTP.

-m   message_count
	Send the specified number of messages (default: 1).

-M   myhostname
        Use the specified hostname or [address] in the HELO
	command and in the  default  sender  and  recipient
	addresses, instead of the machine hostname.

-N     	Prepend a non-repeating sequence number to each recipient address. 
	This avoids the artificial 100% hit rate in the resolve and rewrite 
	client caches and exercises the trivial-rewrite daemon, better 
	approximating  Postfix  performance under real-life work-loads.

-o     	Old mode: don't send HELO, and don't send message headers.

-r   recipient_count
	Send  the specified number of recipients per trans-
        action (default: 1).  Recipient names are generated
        by prepending a number to the recipient address.

-R   min_time, max_time
	Wait for a random period of time  
	(min_time <= n <= max_time) between messages. Suspending 
	one thread does not affect other delivery threads. 
	(**NOTE: Original smtp-source generate between 
	0 <= n <= max_time)

-s   session_count
	Run the specified number of SMTP sessions in parallel 
	(default: 1).

-S   Subject
	Send mail with the  named  subject  line  (default: none).

-t   to  
	Use   the  specified  recipient  address  (default: <foo@myhostname>).

-T   windowsize
        Override the  default  TCP  window  size.  To  work
	around  broken  TCP window scaling implementation,
	specify a value > 0 and < 65536.

-v     	Make the program more verbose, for  debugging  purposes.
	(**NOTE: This options does not display like the original 
	smtp-source(1). However, it is still efficient for debugging)

-w   interval
	Wait a fixed time between messages.  Suspending one
        thread does not affect other delivery threads.



------ ADDITIONAL ARGUMENTS ------

-a   file_path		
	Attach a file to the email

-log 
	Crete a log file in current directory, which contains the 
	generated attachments sent through the server.   

-ra  folder_path		
	Attach a random file inside a given folder to the email.

-rl  min_length, max_length	
	Generate a random length bytes as message payload. 
	The length does not include message headers. 

-tm	Display elapse-time while the connections are made, send emails, 
	and disconnect the server. (Since the commands are tweaked under python, 
	using "time smtp-sauce ..." will not calculate the accurate time.)

[inet:]host[:port]
        Connect via  TCP  to  host  host,  port  port.  
	The default port is smtp.
